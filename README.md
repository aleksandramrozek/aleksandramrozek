# Hi there 👋
## Welcome to my ✨ GitHub repository ✨

I’m currently working on how to operate in GitHub and Pycharm for my Tech Basics Class 2nd semester 🚀! 
Can't wait to become as good at programming as **Moritz Zimmermann** from HTSD (online) 💊 
That is actually a joke....

### I am currently working on 🎆:
- Learning and understanding how **GitHub works**
- Getting familiar with coding in **PyCharm**
- Using Markdown in creative ways
- Cloning repositories and understanding Git workflows
